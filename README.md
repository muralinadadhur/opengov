# API Tests for OpenGov movie project
Tools used : Cucumber, RestAssured and Maven

Cucumber : Used to define scenarions that are defined as Automation steps in the MovieAPISteps class.

RestAssured : Open source platform used to make API calls in BDD style.

Spring : Used as dependency inject by defining a bean which contains the POJO so any subsequent steps can use the bean instead of making API calls.

Maven : Used for capturing all project dependencies and test execution.
